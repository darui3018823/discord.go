## dgo direct message ping-pong example

This example demonstrates how to use dgo to create a ping-pong bot
that sends the response through Direct Message.

This Bot will respond to "ping" in any server it's in with "Pong!" in the
sender's DM.

For dgo-specific problems, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/darui3018823/discord.go/issues).

### Build

This assumes you already have a working Go environment setup and that
Go 1.26.6 or newer and the module dependencies are available.

From within the dm_pingpong example folder, run the below command to compile the
example.

```sh
go build
```

### Usage

This example supports bot tokens only. Automated user accounts and raw user
credentials are prohibited and are not supported by dgo.

```
./dm_pingpong --help
Usage of ./dm_pingpong:
  -t string
        Bot token
```

The below example shows how to start the bot

```sh
./dm_pingpong -t YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
Bot is now running.  Press CTRL-C to exit.
```
