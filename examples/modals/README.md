## dgo modals example

This example demonstrates how to use dgo to send and process text
inputs in modals. If you have not read `slash_commands` and `components`
examples yet it is recommended to do so before proceeding. As this example
is built using interactions and Slash Commands.

### Build

This assumes you already have a working Go environment setup and that
Go 1.26.6 or newer and the module dependencies are available.

From within the modals example folder, run the below command to compile the
example.

```sh
go build
```

### Usage
