## dgo context menu commands example

This example demonstrates how to use dgo to create and use context
menu commands. This example heavily relies on `slash_commands` example in
command handling and registration, therefore it is recommended to be read
before proceeding.

For dgo-specific problems, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/darui3018823/discord.go/issues).
