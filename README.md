# discord.go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/darui3018823/discord.go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/darui3018823/discord.go)

discord.go is an experimental high-level Discord framework for Go. It embeds
the proven REST, Gateway, interaction, state, and Voice implementation forked
from [dgo](https://github.com/darui3018823/dgo), then adds an opinionated bot,
command, component, task, and audio layer on top.

The copied low-level API is intentionally kept available while the high-level
API is developed. Its root Go package is still named `dgo` for now, so callers
may import it with a `discord` alias when preferred.

## Highlights

- Discord API v10 REST and Gateway bindings
- Gateway event handling, state tracking, and voice connections
- DAVE end-to-end voice encryption support
- Context-aware REST rate limiting and bounded retries
- Structured logging with credential redaction
- Safe defaults: no Gateway intents and no parsed mentions unless enabled
- Go 1.26.6 or newer

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/darui3018823/discord.go@v1.1.0
```

Import the package as `dgo`:

```go
import "github.com/darui3018823/discord.go"
```

Create a bot session from a raw bot token. `NewBot` adds the required `Bot `
authorization prefix:

```go
session, err := dgo.NewBot(token)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
session.Identify.Intents = dgo.IntentsGuilds
```

Gateway connections accept bot credentials only. OAuth2 bearer credentials
may be used with applicable REST endpoints. Automated user accounts and
private client routes are not supported.

The exported `VERSION` value and `Version()` function are resolved from Go
build information. Tagged module builds report their tag, pseudo-version
builds report the pseudo-version, and local builds report a `devel` version
with VCS information when available.
