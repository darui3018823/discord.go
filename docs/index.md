dgo provides Go bindings for Discord's REST, Gateway, and Voice APIs. It
supports low-level protocol access together with helpers for bot sessions,
event handling, state tracking, rate limiting, interactions, and voice.

dgo is an independent hard fork of
[bwmarrin/discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo). Use the dgo module
path, documentation, and issue tracker when working with this repository.
